      <p> I am a Finance and Mathematics graduate student with 1st class honours looking to utilise my research and analytical skills and further develop them in a practical and fast-paced environment.  During my time at university I developed strong numerical skills and a great understanding in finance which I believe are very important for someone working as an analyst. I am capable of assuming project management responsibilities and actively contribute to the overall success of any business I work for. </p>

      <p> I have experience working as a Business Analyst for a month-long placement at a company called Intersoft. During my time there I became familiar with the agile lifecycle, Scrum, as an alternative for the traditional waterfall process. I wrote and edited user stories and was creative by making a video user guide where I would produce screen recordings of their software. </p>
      <p> Recently I have also received additional training in business analysis by learning how to do SWOT and MOST analysis on various situations given to me. During this training I also completed a financial analysis on the historical and present stock price data of the company Zoom which shows my ability to analyse data. </p>
      <p> At university I had a final project for my coding course where I wrote a report about how different economic factors affected Olympic results in each country using Python. The other person on my team oversaw the coding side of the project and web scraped data from spreadsheets and cleaned it in Python where it was then my job to analyse  and format these results and draw conclusions on what they meant. We would communicate different ideas on what economic factors we should use considering the limitations of some of the data that only started from 1960. The effort put in was rewarded when we got the highest grade for our project in the class. </p>

      <p> As a student ambassador for my school I needed excellent communication skills to tour prospective students and their parents. This entailed memorising many facts about the school, involving attention to detail which would be important for communicating with clients. </p>
      <p> From achieving my black belt in karate to receiving my Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award I have shown tenacity in aiming and attaining ambitious goals. Furthermore, I am also hardworking, exemplified by my extra GCSE in Chinese for which I achieved an A*, demonstrating my ability to work under increased pressure. </p>
      <p> I have carried out volunteer work in many areas such as teaching children karate and running the school orienteering club which improved my leadership skills. I work well in teams as shown in the 16 years I have played football. I am an accomplished clarinettist playing for Surrey County bands for several years as well as partaking in a wind octet at university. </p>
      <p> As vice-president of K-pop society I demonstrated initiative by improving the organisation and communication of weekly events, using a monthly calendar and surveys to increase attendance. I balanced all this with my study life at university. </p>
